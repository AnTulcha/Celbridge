# .web Files

.web files are a way to view a web page as a document in Celbridge, just as you would with a text file or a spreadsheet.

This is actually an incredibly powerful feature, because it allows you to embed all the web applications, dashboards, online documentation, etc. that you work with all the time right alongside your project data.
