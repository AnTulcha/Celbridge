# Writing Style

Some notes about writing documentation for Celbridge. Just like coding, consistent use of the same conventions everywhere greatly improves ease of reading and editing.

- Use American English
- Using Github Flavoured Markdown
- Use word wrapping instead of editing the text to fit in 120 columns
