- An "operation" is a synchronous or asynchronous task used to accomplish something in the application, e.g. deleting a file, writing data to a file, executing a script, fetching a URL, etc.
- Operations have a well defined lifecycle.
- Operations are created by client code and added to an "OperationScheduler", as part of a "Work Unit"
- A "Work Unit" groups together a set of related operations
    - For example a "Rename" Work Unit might consist of a "Copy File" operation followed by a "Delete File" operation.
- A "Parallel Work Unit" executes all of its operations at the same time, and completes when all the operations have finished.
- A "Serial Work Unit" executes all of its operations one at a time in a defined order.
- Work Units report their progress to listeners as their operations succeed or fail
- A Work Unit completes when all of its operations have completed, reporting which specific operations have succeeded or failed
- Client code can cancel a Work Unit, for example if one of the operations fails.
- Client code can use a Work Unit to implement Transactions, by rolling back a set of operations if any of the operations fail.
- A common practice is to record an "Undo Work Unit" for certain types of Work Unit that the user may wish to undo at a later point. These "Undo Work Units" are defined when the Work Unit is scheduled, but are only added to the undo stack if the Work Unit completes successfully.
