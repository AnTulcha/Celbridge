# Build Instructions

## Windows

Follow the installation instructions on this page:
https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-vs-2022.html

Open the Celbridge.sln file in Visual Studio.
Build and run the Celbridge.Windows (Package) project head.

## Linux

Follow the instructions on this page:
https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-with-linux.html?tabs=ubuntu1804

On Windows 11, you just need to install WSL + Ubuntu and GTK 3.
Build and run the Skia.Gtk + WSL project head.
The app will run in Linux using WSL.

## Mac

Install everything here:
https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-vsmac.html

We don't support MacCatalyst, so just build and run the Skia.Gtk project head.

Note: Visual Studio for Mac is being deprecated. I expect they'll migrate to VS Code for all platforms.
